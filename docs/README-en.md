# Developer Radar

Developer Radar is a public, read-only developer content site built on top of DjangoBlog and reshaped for curated tech writing and AI news aggregation.

It focuses on two content streams:

- `Technical Summaries`: RSS/Atom tech articles rewritten into Chinese with an LLM
- `AI News`: headline-style updates collected from `https://aihot.virxact.com/`

## What this fork is for

This repository is no longer positioned as a generic multi-user blog platform. It is now optimized for:

- personal branding sites
- resume-ready showcase projects
- curated developer content portals
- public browsing with private maintenance

## Current highlights

- Public read-only mode with `GET/HEAD` only
- `404` on `/admin/`, `/login/`, `/register/`, `/upload` and other write-oriented routes
- Scheduled collectors for tech articles and AI news
- LLM-based rewriting through an OpenAI-compatible API
- MySQL-backed storage
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, rate limiting, and canonical handling
- Host deployment with Supervisor, plus optional Docker Compose packaging

## Upstream attribution

This project is a secondary development based on the upstream DjangoBlog project:

- `https://github.com/liangliangyy/DjangoBlog`

The upstream codebase provides the Django content foundation. This fork adds product-level changes around public read-only access, article/news collection, LLM rewriting, deployment, and frontend presentation.

## License note

The repository keeps the upstream license file. For a derivative work based on an MIT-licensed upstream project, preserving the license notice and clear attribution is the practical default.
